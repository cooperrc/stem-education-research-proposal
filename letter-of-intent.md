3. Brief description of the proposed project

How can data science be best incoroporated into STEM curricula? Can you
use access to data science tools to motivate+encourage K-12
underrepresented populations in STEM?

STEM students still learn concepts with static textbooks and tables.
This dated educational practice is a barrier to inclusive learning. 
Teachers must either force their expertise into the textbook
style or use 100's of hours to build a textbook. Both options leave
students underwhelmed. Modern engineering relies on computer literacy,
but STEM fields still rely on resources that are computer illiterate. 

I have been building open educational resources for mechanical
engineering students for over five years. Students can analyze data,
answer questions, and even create their own educational resources from
the same framework. Using data science tools like Jupyter, GitHub, and Python, I
can publish resources, collect assignments, and build new interactive
learning tools. 

Callysto has built a strong network of K-12 educators. Callysto has a
network of trainers and educators. Trainers help educators gain new data
science skills and educators teach K-12 students STEM concepts with
modern tools.  

Both Callysto and UConn have developed the need for better access to
data science tools. 2i2c empowers education to be more accessible,
intuitive, and enjoyable. 2i2c manages and builds interactive computing
infrastructure for education. They can tailor the resources for our
learning communities. 

Our hypothesis is that if we fill this gap in data science tools for
STEM education we will get better student engagement and create more
inclusive tools for underrepresented communities.  With our combined
expertise, UConn+Callysto+2i2c, we can create a framework to build and
distribute open interactive STEM educational resources _and_ train
educators to use the material and build new open educational resources. 

Our aim is to build upon success of Callysto in Canada, the Carpentries
globally and OpenScapes in the US to create open and inclusive data
science resources for STEM students. We will develop new open
educational resources, supplement content with best practices, and the
teachers train teachers program, and leverage ongoing CanCODE 3.0
funding with Callysto to build international partnerships with 2i2c and
other networks. Accomplishing these tasks will create new educational
resources for STEM students that are more interactive and inclusive.

6. duration of proposed project 
Development and Innovation: (max 4 years) + (max $2,000,000)

7. estimated total budget request
Development and Innovation: (max 4 years) + (max $2,000,000)

With $2,000,000 we plan to divide the budget into 

1. project lead $150,000 / year: salary and RA
2. trainer/ambassador: $100,000 / year
3. infrastructure and hub support: $50,000 / year
4. content development program: $100,000 / year
5. training events: $100,000 / year

__total: $500,000 / year x 4 years = $2,000,000__

Format + page limit: fill in a response to each of the 7 areas above.
