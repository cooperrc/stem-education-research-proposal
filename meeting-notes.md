## 2021/08/05 - IES Exploration + Dev/Innovation Topics
- https://ies.ed.gov/director/sro/ <- review process
- Education Research Competition:
    - identify topic
    - project type: guides type of work
        - exploration: understand factors that affect learning outcomes (student skills, etc.) -> understand theory to lead to dev/innov
        - dev/innov: develop an intervention (program/policy/curriculum) 2-3 years iteratively developing and pilot testing
- Need someone on the proposal with grant management experience
- must conduct a pilot study as part of dev/innov
- [Cost analysis](https://ies.ed.gov/seer/cost_analysis.asp)
- No requirements for nationality of researchers. The project just needs
  to be relevant to U.S. education.  Note that budgets for non-U.S.
  institutions cannot charge indirect costs.
- you don't need external evaluators
- dev/innov: 
    - new or modified
    - significance: why is it improvement? leanrning? user-friendly? 
    - clear: here is the "value proposition"
    - this "online learning tool" will "lead to better learning"
    - here is why the additional components needs the additional
      development
    - useability, feasibility, how to support implementation
    - can teachers+admin use as intended?
    - research aims: is this working as intended? is this better than
      current practice
    - how much will this cost?
    - use RFA (recommendations sections) vocabulary
- do the personnel have the necessary experience?
    - science education
    - expertise with tech products
    - expertise with stats
    - highlight in personnel section
    - interdisciplinary teams
- Articulate the aims early+often pg 1 of Narrative
- Strong "theory of change" that is grounded in literature is important
    - logic model = visual representation mediators/moderators and outcomes (influences
      that affect the students)
    - teach about sci inquiry that has not been done, if I construct
      product, then that would lead to improvement in sci inquiry
    - do a thorough review of these hypotheses (most recent knowledge)

How to incorporate data science into traditional engineering work?

K - 12 audience in CA:
- financial literacy
- how do we demonstrate
- Callysto == computational thinking and data literacy
- content generation model: Graduate or undergraduate students create content for K-12 students under supervision of PIMS' professor

Grants with Callysto:
- recognize gap in data science literacy
- awareness in this area, may let us explore curriculum 
- CanCode: target underrepresented groups (women+minorities) partnerships to encourage 

US / Canada Grant Eligibility
- what are the rules around this?

## Possible Collaboration

- UConn + Callysto both have growing need for computational resources
- 2i2c can provide expertise/infrastructure for Jupyter/Data science in education
- UConn is building open educational resources in higher ed + can create K-12 applications to reach underrep STEM recruitment
- Callysto has a wide network of learners + educators that can scale and provide access to open educational resources for data science in STEM
    - trainers: educators lack data science + comp sci background
    - trainers fill a gap in adding resources to curriculum
    - trainers help educators use resources independently
    - get creators (grad + undergrad) to get in front of audiences
