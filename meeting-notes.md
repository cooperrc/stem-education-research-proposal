## 2021/08/05 - IES Exploration + Dev/Innovation Topics
- https://ies.ed.gov/director/sro/ <- review process
- Education Research Competition:
    - identify topic
    - project type: guides type of work
        - exploration: understand factors that affect learning outcomes (student skills, etc.) -> understand theory to lead to dev/innov
        - dev/innov: develop an intervention (program/policy/curriculum) 2-3 years iteratively developing and pilot testing

How to incorporate data science into traditional engineering work?

K - 12 audience in CA:
- financial literacy
- how do we demonstrate
- Callysto == computational thinking and data literacy
- content generation model: Graduate or undergraduate students create content for K-12 students under supervision of PIMS' professor

Grants with Callysto:
- recognize gap in data science literacy
- awareness in this area, may let us explore curriculum 
- CanCode: target underrepresented groups (women+minorities) partnerships to encourage 

US / Canada Grant Eligibility
- what are the rules around this?

## Possible Collaboration

- UConn + Callysto both have growing need for computational resources
- 2i2c can provide expertise/infrastructure for Jupyter/Data science in education
- UConn is building open educational resources in higher ed + can create K-12 applications to reach underrep STEM recruitment
- Callysto has a wide network of learners + educators that can scale and provide access to open educational resources for data science in STEM
    - trainers: educators lack data science + comp sci background
    - trainers fill a gap in adding resources to curriculum
    - trainers help educators use resources independently
    - get creators (grad + undergrad) to get in front of audiences
